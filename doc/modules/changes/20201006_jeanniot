New: Benchmarks of the gravity postprocessor with a PREM density 
material model plugin. The first benchmark consists in calculating
gravity acceleration and potential for a hollow sphere filled with
a single material of constant density, compared with the analytical
solution. The second benchmark calculates gravity acceleration, 
potential and gradients for a full sphere filled with PREM density.
Both benchmarks also serve as a tutorial to use the functionality of 
the postprocessor gravity_point_values, including a list of points, 
a radial profile, an equiangular or equidistant (uniform) field of 
points, the latter using the Fibonacci spiral sampling scheme.
